people with poor social ability or poor relationships with others, or those who live a life of monotony are much easier to be attracted by games, with the stimulation of both sound and scene that the game created, gamers' senses or feelings such as pleasure, tesion, excitement and so on, are pretty much enlarged. Which means, if you feel happy before you play Mario, then you'll feel much happier when you get your first mushroom. This kind of emotion enlargement makes gamers feel so satisfied. In fact, it minimized, or even removed the influence of lack of content relationships in society.
